## What is an Eclipse?

An **eclipse** occurs when one celestial body moves into the shadow of another, temporarily blocking or partially obscuring light. There are two main types of eclipses visible from Earth: **solar eclipses** and **lunar eclipses**. These events are rare, awe-inspiring, and scientifically significant.

### Solar Eclipse

A **solar eclipse** happens when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, casting a shadow on the Earth. Solar eclipses can be classified into three types:
- **Total Solar Eclipse**: The Moon completely covers the Sun, turning day into night.
- **Partial Solar Eclipse**: Only part of the Sun is obscured by the Moon.
- **Annular Solar Eclipse**: The Moon is farther from the Earth, leaving a "ring of fire" around the Sun.

#### Why Solar Eclipses Are Special
Solar eclipses are rare and only visible from specific regions on Earth. A total solar eclipse, where the Sun is completely blocked, is a breathtaking event that draws crowds of eclipse chasers.

### Lunar Eclipse

A **lunar eclipse** happens when the Earth passes between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the Moon. Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses can be seen from anywhere on the night side of Earth. There are three types:
- **Total Lunar Eclipse**: The Earth's shadow completely covers the Moon, often turning it red (Blood Moon).
- **Partial Lunar Eclipse**: Only part of the Moon is covered by Earth's shadow.
- **Penumbral Lunar Eclipse**: The Moon passes through Earth's outer shadow, causing a subtle darkening.

#### Why Lunar Eclipses Are Special
Lunar eclipses are more common than solar eclipses and are visible from a larger area. They are safe to observe with the naked eye and provide a stunning visual display.

## The Science Behind Eclipses

Eclipses occur due to the alignment of the Earth, Moon, and Sun. The Moon's orbit is tilted, so eclipses don't happen every month. When the three bodies align perfectly, an eclipse occurs.

- **Solar Eclipses** happen during a **New Moon** phase.
- **Lunar Eclipses** occur during a **Full Moon** phase.

Because the Moon’s orbit is tilted by about 5 degrees, perfect alignment only happens during specific times of the year.

## Upcoming Eclipses

Stay up to date with the next eclipses. Check out our **Eclipse Calendar** for upcoming solar and lunar eclipses, including visibility maps, timings, and the best locations to observe them.

## Fascinating Eclipse Facts

- The longest total solar eclipse of the 21st century occurred on **July 22, 2009**, lasting up to 7 minutes and 29 seconds.
- A lunar eclipse can turn the Moon red due to Rayleigh scattering of sunlight through Earth's atmosphere.
- Solar eclipses occur **2 to 5 times per year**, but are only visible from specific paths on Earth.
- The most recent total solar eclipse in the U.S. occurred on **August 21, 2017**.

## Cultural Significance of Eclipses

Eclipses have been seen as powerful omens or divine events throughout history. Different cultures have their own interpretations:
- **Ancient Chinese** believed eclipses were caused by dragons eating the Sun.
- **Greek mythology** considered solar eclipses signs of divine wrath.
- **Native American** cultures viewed lunar eclipses as times of spiritual renewal.

At Moon X, we explore how these ancient stories shape our modern understanding of eclipses.

## How to View Eclipses Safely

**Never look directly at a solar eclipse** without proper protection. Looking at the Sun without eclipse glasses or a solar viewer can cause permanent eye damage.

### Solar Eclipses:
- Always use **eclipse glasses** or a **solar viewer** to protect your eyes.
- Regular sunglasses are **not** safe.
- Use a **solar filter** if you're viewing through binoculars or a telescope.

### Lunar Eclipses:
- Lunar eclipses are safe to observe with the naked eye.
- Binoculars or a telescope can enhance the experience, but are not required.
